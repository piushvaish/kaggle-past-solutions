## About
If you are facing a data science problem or just want to learn, there is a good chance that you can find inspiration here !

## Contributing
Many competitions are missing links to their solutions, evaluation and type.

To contribute:
 - Fork the repo
 - Edit the **competitions.yaml** file (you can even edit it with Github's editor)
 - Make a pull request

For each competition missing the data, please add `types` and `solutions`.

The solutions should be links to the Kaggle forum (if possible) or blog posts.

For instance, you might add:

    types:
      - "Speech recognition"
    solutions:
      -
        label: "1st place solution"
